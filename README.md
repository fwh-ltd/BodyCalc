Description
---

**BodyCalc** is a simple application for women to calculate things like BMI (Body Mass Index) and Body Shape, and 
can also be used to approximate things like Breast Size, Butt Size and Body Type.

It is _not_ designed to be 100% accurate, and probably _never_ will be, though it strives to be as accurate as is possible.

Usage
---

Using the application is simple, just enter your measurements on the left side and click Calculate to see your results
on the right side.

All measurements must be entered to get complete results. However, you can calculate some items individually.

**For Example:** To calculate BMI, enter your Height and Weight and click Calculate. 

If you are missing the necessary measurements to make a certain calculation "**Error!**" will appear in the results section
for that item.

Notes
---

All measurements must be in inches, except for Height and Weight (which need to be in metric, meters and kilograms respectively).

Breast Size can only be calculated if both the Bust measurement and Cup size are entered.

**Shortcut Keys:**

\ - Clear All Input Fields
